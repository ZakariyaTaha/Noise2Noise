# Noise2Noise

Our model was inspired by the paper 
```Lehtinen, J. et al. (2018) ‘Noise2Noise: Learning Image Restoration without Clean Data’ Available at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04189``` 
and was trained on this dataset [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rOxISUac8J6cHhccWPbJpiHT4PzGqm5K?usp=sharing).
